[UNDER DEVELOPMENT] Redesign of MorphCX to run as a multi-module Java application 
supporting both GUI and CLI front ends.

The development objectives are to:

* Redesign morphing algorithms so that they are reusable and more easily maintained.
* Migrate to the Java 11+ code base and utilize its new language features.
* Upgrade to Junit 5 and FXTest test frameworks.
* As a proof-of-concept, develop the capability to import CX networks from Excel workbook files.
